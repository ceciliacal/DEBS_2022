-Java
-Docker
-Docker compose
-Gradle

And follow the next steps:
-> go into docker folder and execute: sudo docker-compose up
-> in thesis folder, open a terminal and execute: gradle consumer
-> after running gradle consumer, open another terminal and execute: gradle run 

So it's necessary to execute "gradle consumer" FIRST and "gradle run" later in two separated shells.
